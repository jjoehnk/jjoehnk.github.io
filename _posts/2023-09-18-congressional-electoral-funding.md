description: <p>The United States spends more money on elections than any other nation, and even more so following the controversial Supreme Court decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Committee in 2010 that prohibited the government from restricting independent expenditures on political campaigns by third-party groups.</p><p>In this project, the focus is to explore the relationship between funding that comes from special interest groups, in particular from the Super PACs made possible by the Citizens United decision, and the voting behavior of elected congress members who either receive their funding directly or benefit indirectly from their expenditures.</p><p>Data from the Federal Election Commission is pulled through their open API into a SQL database for analysis in Python and visualization in Tableau.</p><p><a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jonas.joehnk/viz/CongressionalFundingInterestsandVotingPatterns/IntroductionTemplate">Tableau Dashboard</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/jjoehnk/FEC_Voting">GitHub Repository</a></p>
